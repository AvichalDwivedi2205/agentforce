## Limitations
- Some sources refer to data from 2025, which may include projections or early Q1 data rather than full-year actuals.
- The exact methodology for calculating 'AI startup funding' across all sources is not explicitly detailed, which could lead to slight variations in reported figures.
- The term 'AI-related companies' can be broad, potentially encompassing companies that use AI but are not exclusively AI startups.
